#### Project Overview  
- Design and model data in MongoDB to support specific queries from a music app dataset
- Build an ETL pipeline to extract data from CSV files and load them into MongoDB collections.
- Queries to be supported include:
    - Give the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history that was heard during sessionId = 338, and itemInSession = 4
    - Give only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user (first and last name) for userid = 10, sessionid = 182
    - Give every user name (first and last) in my music app history who listened to the song 'All Hands Against His Own'
